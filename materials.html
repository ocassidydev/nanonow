                    Nanomaterials can be defined as any solid with a nanoscopic dimension. By dimension, we don't mean some kind of crazy alternate reality, just the somewhat
                    less exciting definition of a measurement of length.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the nomenclature of nanoscience, it is typical to define different nanomaterial categories with respect to the number of non-nanoscopic (>100nm) dimensions they 
                    posess. Nanoscopic dimensions are treated as effectively non-existence due to their incredibly small size. As such materials are referred to as being lower 
                    dimensions than the 3-D objects we are used to - either dots, lines, or sheets! Read on to learn more.

                <h2>The dots: 0-D materials</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    We'll begin by looking at the simplest of all nanomaterials: those with only nanoscopic dimensions, the 0-D materials. These are structures, mostly (but not 
                    necessarily) spheres that can be as few as a dozen atoms wide. Broadly speaking, two types of these exist: metallic nanoparticles, and extended molecular 
                    structures.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Metallic nanoparticles are self-descriptive - extremely small bits of metal. This seems unremarkable at first, until acknowledging a simple fact - 
                    at such a small volume, much of the constituent atoms of these particles are at or close to the surface. This gives rise to vastly different behavior than is 
                    observed with "bulk" metal, as being dominated by the surface atoms causes very different chemistry - namely a greater level of reactivity. As such, they are 
                    often used as catalysts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The famous example of extended molecular structures are the fullerenes, namely buckministerfullerene (C60) affectionately named after 
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckminster_Fuller" target="_blank">Buckminster Fuller</a> for their geodesic dome shape, pictured above and in the figure. These are 
                    spherical molecules of carbon bonded to itself, and were first dicovered accidentally in soot in 1985. Buckministerfullerene is a good benchmark for the nanoscale, 
                    as it has a diameter of 1.1 nm.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Other extended molecular structures are also possible, such as nanoparticles made out of lipid molecules, which have gained interest in recent years as a method
                    of drug delivery, notably used in many of the COVID-19 vaccines that were offered. Here of course the definition starts to get fuzzy - if any extended structure
                    on the under 100 nm can be called 0-D, then many viruses and hemoglobin would also count!

                <h2>The lines: 1-D materials</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    Next we move onto somewhat more stringy class of nanomaterial: those with 1 non-nanoscopic dimension, the 1-D materials. These types of structures are classed by
                    having a length at least 1000 times greater than their width and thickness, hence being described as lines and 1-dimensional. Two examples we'll discuss are 
                    nanotubes and nanowires.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Nanotubes are extended linear molecular structures. The most famous of these are single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) which are pictured. As these structures
                    have walls built out of molecular bonds, they are extremely tough and hard to snap mechanically. This gives nanotubes enourmous tensile strength, with SWCNTs
                    being reported as having tensile strengths in the range of 13-53 GPa - roughly between 10 and 50 times tougher than stainless steel!
                </p> 
                <p>
                    An interesting caveat about nanotubes is the fact that their properties change depending on their configuration - how the individual atoms are arranged with 
                    respect to each other in to make the tube walls. As an example, some conformations of SWCNTs can be conductive, while others are semiconducting. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    As well as nanotubes, we have nanowires. What metallic nanoparticles are to 0-D materials, nanowires are to 1-D materials - extremely thin strands of metal. 
                    Similar to nanoparticles, the enhanced surfaced area causes different behaviour compared to their bulk counterparts. One potential use of these is as waveguides
                    for light to enable photonics - which would mean information processing devices that use light instead of electricity!
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is also interesting to note something familiar to us counts as a 1-D material: DNA. This is in effect a linear crystal that can be up to a few metres long,
                    while only being a few nanometres wide.

                <h2>The sheets: 2-D Materials</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>Finally, we come to perhaps the most widely-studied class of nanomaterial: those with 2 non-nanoscopic dimensions, the 2-D materials. These structures are 
                    classified by having lengths and widths at least 1000 times greater than their thickness. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the study of 2-D materials in particular, the quantity relating length and width to thickness is known as the aspect ratio, and is often reported to 
                    characterize material properties. This is because for 2-D materials, the ratio of length/width to thickness significantly factors into the material's observed 
                    behaviour, such as the mechanical and electronic properties. These stem from the nature of such materials as extended molecular structures, along with the 
                    confinement of charge carriers to a thin plane.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of the better known 2-D materials is graphene, which is an atomically thin sheet of carbon bonded to itself in a hexagonal pattern. Famously discovered in 
                    2004 by tearing graphite apart with sticky tape, this material has superlative mechanical strength and electrical conductivity, along with a host of unique optical
                    properties such as transparency, a unique trait among conductors. It has long been used as the work-horse of 2-D material research, mainly because the starting 
                    material needed to make it (graphite) is cheap and abundant. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    A complement to graphene is boron nitride, which is also a sheet of hexagonal arranged atoms, only alternating between boron and nitrogen instead. This material is by contrast
                    insulating, and as such is researched for use in dielectrics. It is also shown to be a highly flame-resistant material, owing to it's large thermal conductivity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another 2-D material that has evoked recent research interest in molybdenum disulfide (MoS2). This material is made of layers 3 atoms thick, with layers
                    alternating between sulfur and molybdenum atoms. The main attraction to MoS2 is its semiconducting behavior with a suitably sized bandgap. As deposited films of
                    2-D materials are flexible in nature, MoS2 may promise to yield flexible information technology going into the future.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It should be noted that in most 2-D material research and applications, acheiving single layers of material is not always needed. Most 2-D materials produced by 
                    scalable techniques reported in the literature are in fact few-layer at least, with monolayer material only being produced by methods that are impractical to scale. 
                    However, as long as the nanosheets are sufficiently thin, 2-D material properties are exhibited.
