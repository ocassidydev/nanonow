                    Nanomaterials can be defined as any solid with a nanoscopic dimension. By dimension, we don't mean some kind of crazy alternate reality, just the somewhat
                    less exciting definition of a measurement of length.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the nomenclature of nanoscience, it is typical to define different nanomaterial categories with respect to the number of nanoscopic dimensions they posess. 
                    Such dimensions are treated as effectively non-existence due to their incredibly small size. As such materials are referred to as being lower dimensions than the 
                    3-D objects we are used to - either dots lines or sheets! Read on to learn more.

                <h2>The dots: 0-D materials</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    We'll begin by looking at the simplest of all nanomaterials: those with only nanoscopic dimensions, the 0-D materials. These are structures, mostly (but not 
                    necessarily) spheres that can be as few as a dozen atoms wide. Broadly speaking, two types of these exist: metallic nanoparticles, and extended molecular 
                    structures.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Metallic nanoparticles are self-descriptive - extremely small bits of metal. This seems unremarkable at first, until acknowledging a simple fact - 
                    at such a small volume, much of the constituent atoms of these particles are at or close to the surface. This gives rise to vastly different behavior than is 
                    observed with "bulk" metal, as being dominated by the surface atoms causes very different chemistry - namely a greater level of reactivity. As such, they are 
                    often used as catalysts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The famous example of extended molecular structures are the fullerenes, namely buckministerfullerene (C60) affectionately named after 
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckminster_Fuller">Buckminster Fuller</a> for their geodesic dome shape, pictured above and across. These are spherical 
                    molecules of carbon bonded to itself, and were first dicovered accidentally in soot in 1985. Buckministerfullerene is a good benchmark the nanoscale as it has a 
                    diameter of 1.1 nm.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Other extended molecular structures are also possible, such as nanoparticles made out of lipid molecules, which have gained interest in recent years as a method
                    of drug delivery, notably used in many of the COVID-19 vaccines that were offered. Here of course the definition starts to get fuzzy - if any extended structure
                    on the under 100 nm can be called 0-D, then many viruses and hemoglobin count!

                <p>Metallic nanoparticles: there are as many types of these as there are metals, and they can come in many shapes other than spheres.</p>
