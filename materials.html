                    Nanomaterials can be defined as any solid with a nanoscopic dimension. By dimension, we don't mean some kind of crazy alternate reality, just the somewhat
                    less exciting definition of a measurement of length.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the nomenclature of nanoscience, it is typical to define different nanomaterial categories with respect to the number of non-nanoscopic (>100nm) dimensions they 
                    posess. Nanoscopic dimensions are treated as effectively non-existence due to their incredibly small size. As such materials are referred to as being lower 
                    dimensions than the 3-D objects we are used to - either dots lines or sheets! Read on to learn more.

                <h2>The dots: 0-D materials</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    We'll begin by looking at the simplest of all nanomaterials: those with only nanoscopic dimensions, the 0-D materials. These are structures, mostly (but not 
                    necessarily) spheres that can be as few as a dozen atoms wide. Broadly speaking, two types of these exist: metallic nanoparticles, and extended molecular 
                    structures.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Metallic nanoparticles are self-descriptive - extremely small bits of metal. This seems unremarkable at first, until acknowledging a simple fact - 
                    at such a small volume, much of the constituent atoms of these particles are at or close to the surface. This gives rise to vastly different behavior than is 
                    observed with "bulk" metal, as being dominated by the surface atoms causes very different chemistry - namely a greater level of reactivity. As such, they are 
                    often used as catalysts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The famous example of extended molecular structures are the fullerenes, namely buckministerfullerene (C60) affectionately named after 
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckminster_Fuller">Buckminster Fuller</a> for their geodesic dome shape, pictured above and in the figure. These are 
                    spherical molecules of carbon bonded to itself, and were first dicovered accidentally in soot in 1985. Buckministerfullerene is a good benchmark the nanoscale 
                    as it has a diameter of 1.1 nm.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Other extended molecular structures are also possible, such as nanoparticles made out of lipid molecules, which have gained interest in recent years as a method
                    of drug delivery, notably used in many of the COVID-19 vaccines that were offered. Here of course the definition starts to get fuzzy - if any extended structure
                    on the under 100 nm can be called 0-D, then many viruses and hemoglobin count!

                <h2>The lines: 1-D materials</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    Next we move onto somewhat more stringy class of nanomaterial: those with 1 non-nanoscopic dimension, the 1-D materials. These types of structures are classed by
                    having a length at least 1000 times greater than their width and thickness, hence being described as lines and 1-dimensional. Two examples we'll discuss are 
                    nanotubes and nanowires.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Nanotubes are extended linear molecular structures. The most famous of these are single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) which are pictured. As these structures
                    have walls built out of molecular bonds, they are extremely tough and hard to snap mechanically. This gives nanotubes enourmous tensile strength, with SWCNTs
                    being reported as having tensile strengths in the range of 13-53 GPa - roughly between 10 and 50 times tougher than stainless steel!
                </p> 
                <p>
                    An interesting caveat about nanotubes is the fact that their properties change depending on their configuration - how the individual atoms are arranged with 
                    respect to each other in to make the tube walls. As an example, some conformations of SWCNTs can be conductive, while others are semiconducting. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    As well as nanotubes, we have nanowires. What metallic nanoparticles are to 0-D materials, nanowires are to 1-D materials - extremely thin strands of metal. 
                    Similar to nanoparticles, the enhanced surfaced area causes different behaviour compared to their bulk counterparts. One potential use of these is as waveguides
                    for light to enable photonics - which would mean information processing devices that use light instead of electricity!
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is also interesting to note something familiar to us counts as a 1-D material: DNA. This is in effect a linear crystal that can be up to a few metres long,
                    while only being a few nanometres wide.

                <p>Finally, we come to perhaps the most widely-studied class of nanomaterial: those with 2 non-nanoscopic dimensions, the 2-D materials. These structures are classified
                    by having lengths and widths at least 1000 times greater than their thickness. In the study of 2-D materials in particular, the quantity relating length and width to 
                    thickness is known as the aspect ratio, and is often reported
