                    Nanotechnology may not mean miniature robots like the one pictured just yet, but it will soon have an outsized impact in a big way on the technology we use
                    everyday and enable the next great digital transformation of the world around us. This will be by no means an exhaustive list of applications, as we are focusing on 
                    a specific set of applications of the electronic properties of 2-D materials.

                    <p>
                        A major area of interest for using 2-D materials such as graphene is in batteries. This is because graphene has a very high specific surface area (surface area 
                        per kg of mass) owing to its sheet-like geometry. This gives a larger amount of area to absorb ions on for every kg of graphene put into the batteries anode, 
                        which in turn increases the power density when charged, and will enable batteries to become smaller and lighter. Existing lithium-ion technology has a specific 
                        capacity of 180 Wh per kg, whereas graphene theoretically has a power density of 1000 Wh per kg - an over fivefold decrease in the amount of mass needed to 
                        store the same amount of power! 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Graphene's superior conductivity also promises significantly faster charging speeds than currently existing battery technology. This will be of prime importance
                        as the world increasingly upgrades to electric vehicle and grid-scale storage technology. It is also flexible, and so could potentially enable flexible energy
                        storage. Finally, the suuply of raw materials to make graphene are by far less environmentally damaging and geopolitically sensitive as those materials that 
                        go into current battery technologies.

                    As has been already alluded to, a significant advantage to 2-D materials such as graphene and MoS2 is that they are flexible, unlike traditional metals and
                    semiconductors, which are typically brittle. This opens a range of technological possiblilities, particularly in wearable technology.
                    It may one day be possible to wear technology as skintight smart clothing instead of carrying around phones and laptops, shown are demonstrations of this in principle.

                    Of course, no reason that wearable devices would only be realized only as clothing. Another feature of 2D materials is that they are mostly harmless on exposure, 
                    and as such are described as biocompatible. 2-D materials can also be suspended in inks. Together, this opens the possibility for adhering them directly to human 
                    skin as temporary tatoos. Already examples of this have been prototyped, such as by the 
                    <a href="https://nano.tau.ac.il/hanein/index.php/projects/tattoo-semg" target="_blank">Yael Hanein Lab</a>. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Such devices could act as accurate sensors of facial and finger movement, opening a whole new world of potential user interfacing. Furthermore, if such technology
                    were incorporated into biological tissue, it could be used track health and provide medical diagnotics, as well as serve as the next great leap in personal 
                    computing.
