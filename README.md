# NanoNow

[NanoNow](https://ocassidydev.github.io/nanonow/) is a science communication website that will serve as a learning resource about all things related to nanoscience. The site will be targeted towards people who are looking to learn about nanomaterials and nanotechnology. Nanonow will be useful to people without a deep scientific background who want accessible information on this topic, along with allowing a means for researchers in the field to communicate their work.

## Features 

### Existing Features
- __Navigation Bar__

    - Featured on each page as a fully responsive element.
    - Fixed in place at the top of the screen while scrolling so that the user can seemlessly navigate the website regardless of where they are on the page.
    - Depending on which page the user is on, the currently active page will be highlighted in the navigation bar.
    - The site logo also serves as a navigation link to get back to the home page.
    - This will be valuable to the user as a means of navigating the site without using the back button and as an indication of where they are in the site.

    &nbsp;
    ![Navigation Bar](assets/readme_images/nav.png)

&nbsp;
- __Hamburger navigation bar__

    - Under certain screen sizes, the navigation bar on each page disappears and is replaced by a hamburger button
    - This button, coded purely in HTML/CSS, serves as a dropdown menu with all the same navigation links as the naviagtion bar.
    - Hamburger button coded to postion itself under the site logo under certain screen sizes, so that the site logo has space to be read.
    - This will be valuable to users on mobile devices to gain the same functionality as the navigation bar.

### Features Left to Implement

&nbsp;

***About in nav-bar appearance***

One feature that I wanted to implement was a means of the about button in the navigation bar to change to the active color when scrolling down past a certain point of the landing page, so it would look like this: 

![AboutBar](assets/readme_images/aboutbar.PNG)

However as far as I have checked querying how far the user is scrolled down the page is only possible to do with javascript, which is outside of the scope of the module.

&nbsp;

***News Page***

I also wanted to add a page containing a widget that could scrub social media for mentions of nanotechnology using some kind of API, and then display them as a scrollable element. However this is much too complicated for the current point I am at in the course.

&nbsp;

## Testing 
### Navigation Bars
\
&nbsp;
**Navigation Bar**
- The following table goes through each button on the navigation bar, with columns detailing what the button should do when clicked, what it does when clicked, and a check to validate whether these buttons can be considered working or not. Each button was checked individually on each page.

|Button on bar      |Expected Behavior                      |What Occurs                            |Working as intended?   |

### Different viewports
Throughout the project, the appearance of the website was checked using firefox dev tools set devices. I also quickly browsed through the finished site on my phone.

&nbsp;
### Bugs 

  - When the hamburger menu is active for small viewports and the page is loaded, the hamburger icon can take a moment to load in and the button is momentarily thinner that it should be. This is likely because the icon is accessed from font-awesome. A solution to avoid this could be to render the hamburger icon with 3 grey spans instead.  
  - Low contrast between background of figures and the hamburger menu on small viewport sizes. Put a border on the bottom of the hamburger button to make distinction clearer.
  - The applications landing page displayed poorly on mobile as the text was too wide.

&nbsp;
### Validator Testing 

- HTML
  - No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Focassidydev.github.io%2Fnanonow%2Findex.html), with exception to one warning regarding the use of a label in an anchor tag (which was necessary for it to work as intended)
- CSS
  - No errors were found when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Focassidydev.github.io%2Fnanonow%2Findex.html&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en)

&nbsp;
### Unfixed Bugs

   - Bug where hamburger icon fails to load in quick enough on page load.
   - Some pages on the site have a lower than desired lighthouse performance score (materials - 88, applications - 78). This is likely due to the quantity of images in the site and a lack of complete optimisation of image formats. This may cause slower loading times.

&nbsp;
## Deployment

- This project was deployed through github pages at this [link](https://ocassidydev.github.io/nanonow/contact.html), using the following steps:

  - From the github repository, navigated to settings
  - Clicked on "Pages" 
  - On the drop down menu that read "none", clicked and changed to "main"
  - Clicked save

&nbsp;

- For local deployment, run the following command:

      git clone https://github.com/ocassidydev/nanonow.git

&nbsp;
## Credits 

### Code

- The hamburger menu was created with code from a page on [Code-Boxx](https://code-boxx.com/simple-responsive-pure-css-hamburger-menu/).
- Centering the page titles in the image div was obtained from css code on [hubspot](https://blog.hubspot.com/website/center-div-css)
- A number of individual queries and fixes were sought on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/).
- For refreshing certain concepts and documentations, I used [W3S Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/).

&nbsp;
### Content 

- Inspiration was taken from [nano.gov](https://www.nano.gov/about-nanotechnology/applications-nanotechnology) and [Wikipedia's Applications of Nanotechnology page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applications_of_nanotechnology) to populate the site content.
- I used various wikipedia pages on the topic to check my knowledge as I was entering content.
- The icons in the footer were taken from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/).
